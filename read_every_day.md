# COMMANDMENTS

* Work on one thing at a time until finished.
* Start no more new books, add no more new material to "Black Spring."
* Don't be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.
* Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!
* When you can't create you can work.
* Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.
* Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.
* Don't be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.
* Discard the Program when you feel like itâ€”but go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.
* Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing.
* Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.
